# Python Asteroids

## Description
This is a game of asteroids coded entirely with pyhton where after you run the game from the terminal, a GUI will appear and you user the keyboard as for inputs to play the game.

## Controls
Space Bar --> Shoot
Arrows
 - Up --> Accelerate
 - Left --> Rotate Counter-Clockwise
 - Right --> Rotate Clockwise

## Run the Game
Clone the repo to your machine with the command
`git clone repo_url`

Once the repo has been cloned to your machine you need to change the terminal directory to the repo where the files are stored.
This is to avoid a complicated run command where you navigate manually on each run.

`cd /path/to/repo`

next install the requirements for the game

`python3 -m install requirements.txt`

Next you simply run the game with the following command *provided you have python installed on your machine.* If you do not, you will need to follow te steps to install pyhton. here is a [link](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+pyhton&oq=how+to+install+pyhton&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i10i512l9.2048j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

`python3 py_asteroids`

And you're DONE!

I plan to maybe flesh out this project with score tracking and replayablility.

Hope you enjoy!
